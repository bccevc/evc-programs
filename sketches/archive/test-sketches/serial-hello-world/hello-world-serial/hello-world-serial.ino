 OpenLCD is an LCD with serial/I2C/SPI interfaces.

 This example shows how to display a counter on the display over serial. We use software serial because if 
 OpenLCD is attached to an Arduino's hardware serial port during bootloading  it can cause problems for both devices.

 To get this code to work, attached an OpenLCD to an Arduino Uno using the following pins:
 RX (OpenLCD) to Pin 7 (Arduino)
 VIN to 5V
 GND to GND

#include <SoftwareSerial.h>

SoftwareSerial OpenLCD(6, 7); //RX, TX

byte counter = 0;
byte contrast = 2; //Lower is more contrast. 0 to 5 works for most displays.

void setup()
{
  Serial.begin(9600); //Start serial communication at 9600 for debug statements
  Serial.println("OpenLCD Example Code");

  OpenLCD.begin(9600); //Start communication with OpenLCD

  //Send contrast setting
  OpenLCD.write('|'); //Put LCD into setting mode
  OpenLCD.write(24); //Send contrast command
  OpenLCD.write(contrast);

}

void loop()
{
  //Send the clear command to the display - this returns the cursor to the beginning of the display
  OpenLCD.write('|'); //Setting character
  OpenLCD.write('-'); //Clear display

  OpenLCD.print("Hello World!    Counter: "); //For 16x2 LCD
  //OpenLCD.print("Hello World!        Counter: "); //For 20x4 LCD
  OpenLCD.print(counter++);

  delay(250); //Hang out for a bit
}
