# Welcome!

This is BCC's unofficial EVC Truck repository, where all of the files for instrumentation on the truck are stored.

# The File Tree

- `arduino-libraries` contains a couple of the library files used for the Arduino Mega. This is just for reference. Honestly, this might not even be necessary at this point.
- `data` contains the data files of our test runs.
- `docs` contains important documents or manuals.
- `i2c-gps-programs` contains code for the Arduino Mega and UNO to display text on the LCD (using the I2C communication protocol) while getting GPS data (which uses UART serial).
- `imgs` contains images that are displayed on this document.
- `mega` contains code for the Arduino Mega.
    - `canbus123` is the most recent program as of summer 2024 for the truck.
- `test-programs` contains basic programs to demonstrate the basic functionality of the hardware.

# Hardware Overview

- The GPS uses the UART serial communication protocol, and the LCD uses I2C.
- The proto shield is used to help with wire management.

## Hookup Guidelines

### Connecting the GPS

Plug in the 5-wire connection to the GPS module and to the GPS port on the CAN-BUS Shield. The second and the third wire should be stripped and have male ends soldered onto them, which is shown in the image below:

<img src="./imgs/gps-wires.png" alt="Labeled image showing wires 1-5 on GPS module" width="700"/>

The two wires should be connected to the appropriate pins:

|GPS Module|Proto Shield (or Mega)|
|---|---|
|Third (middle) wire|Pin 14|
|Second wire|Pin 15|

### Establishing the SD Card Connection

If the prototyping shield isn't being used, the following are the pins you'd connect on the CAN-BUS and the Mega:

| CAN-BUS | Mega |
|---|---|
|10|53|
|13|52|
|11|51|
|12|50|

If the prototyping shield *is* being used, the following are the pins you'd connect with female-to-female jumper wires:

| Proto Shield | Proto Shield |
|---|---|
|10|53|
|13|52|
|11|51|
|12|50|

### Connecting the LCD

Reference this [hookup guide](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/avr-based-serial-enabled-lcds-hookup-guide/introduction) in general. To hook up the LCD for I2C, see this [part of the hookup guide](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/avr-based-serial-enabled-lcds-hookup-guide/i2c-hardware-hookup--example-code---basic). Here's the [diagram](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/7/8/9/Fritzing_Arduino_SerLCD_I2C_bb.jpg). For some reason, the diagram doesn't include the connections for LCD GND and RAW, so we guessed those.

| LCD | Breadboard | CAN-BUS |
|---|---|---|
|GND|A27||
|RAW|A15||
|SDA|D30 (LV1 on the Logic Level Converter)||
|SCL|D29 (LV2)||
||E16 to -2 (from top right)||
||D28 (LV)|3.3v|
||H28 (HV)|5v|
||-1 (top right)|GND|
||E15|VIN|
||H30 (HV1)|SDA|
||H29 (HV2)|SCL|
||J27 to -27 (from the right)||

Orient the Logic Level Converter as shown in the image below:

## Connecting to the Battery Management System (BMS) on Arduino

- In the Arduino code, make sure the baud rates are the same as the BMS via `CANSPEED_125`.
- In order to retrieve metrics from the BMS, the BMS must be set up with the appropriate parameters under a message identifier. Keep in mind certain parameters take up 2 bytes instead of 1. Within the Arduino code, `if` statements catch messages on the CAN bus protocol. By accessing the appropriate byte from the message identifier, we can retrieve the metric we need from the BMS.
    - Take a look at this `if` statement:
        ``` c++
        if (message.id == 0x123) {
            int CDEC = 0; 
            for (int i = 0; i < 2; i++) { // (1)
                int MDATA = (message.data[i]); 
                CDEC = CDEC + (MDATA*(pow(256, 1-i)));
            }
            lcd.setCursor(0,1); 
            lcd.print("BT:");
            lcd.print(message.data[3],DEC); // (2)
            lcd.print("C");
            lcd.setCursor(17,1);
            lcd.print("#");
            lcd.print(message.data[2],DEC); // (3)
            lcd.setCursor(13,2);
            lcd.print((float)CDEC/10000,3); // (4)
            lcd.print("v");
        }
        ```
        - (1) Gets the low cell voltage by checking bytes 0 and 1.
        - (2) Displays the highest battery temperature.
        - (3) Displays the low cell voltage ID.
        - (4) Displays the low cell voltage from (1).
- You'll see some `for` statements that iterate on the same initialization value. This is intentional. Apparently it gets rid of leading zeroes.
- Check the [editing-canbus-messages](./docs/editing-canbus-messages.pdf) document under `docs` for more information.

Prof Roller also gave each of you "edit" privileges to the BCC EVC 2025 sub-folder (including all lower level folders) :
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Ohkeznx8yyZKjxn91wp-65J9ssRKBGQn?usp=drive_link

Prof Roller created a sub-folder for the weekly logs:
BCC EV Truck Main Folder>BCC EVC 2025>EVC Spring 2025>Logbooks
Omer- please put your Arduino/Instrumentation logs here.
We should start a log for the other work we are doing on the truck.

# Summer 2025 Todo List
- [ ] Reformat SD card to be CSV-ready (what column corresponds to what metric was documented)
- [ ] Build another instrumentation set
- [ ] Rewire instrumentation hardware to be more robust
- [ ] Write more helpful error messages (what canbus message isn't being delivered)
- [ ] Check why Arduino seems to only display A & V when plugged into IDE
- [ ] Create new output file every time Arduino is started (new trial)
- [ ] Log power from grid during charging (power meter)
